# Test_Capgemini

Done: 
- Implement authorization with Github. The search must be available after sign in. Unauthorized user can see previous search results.
- The UI/screen during the search must not be blocked;
- Get 30 repositories per one request (first 15 of the first thread and other 15 of the second thread) - and then merge the repositories.
- Allow to view previous results without an internet connection and mark them as viewedÂ after opening the repository.
- Allow to store previous search results (CoreData).
- Upon clicking on the repository name a browser will open leading to the main page. It has to open as a modal window (not for full the screen). You have to be able to drag down this modal window to close it.


In Progress: 

- optimization at some places of code commented as todo:
- 2 thread implementation is in progress
- search needs to be optimized , but working for the time being
- pagination, start /stop is in process
- repo sorting by stars is in process
- delete, drag of searched repositories - in progress
